  <h5>How do I pay for my online advertising?</h5>
  <p>MetaPro Support is a comprehensive solution that will help you to easily and painlessly create and manage all of your online advertising. When using our platform, nothing will change with respect to payments: all the Facebook advertising managed and created via MetaPro Support will still be billed by Facebook respectively with the billing options you set up on your advertising accounts. What you’ll be paying us is the subscription for the use of the platform.</p>
  <br>


  <h5>What happens to my Facebook  campaigns if I cancel my MetaPro Support subscription?</h5>
  <p>If you decide to cancel your MetaPro Support subscription, nothing will happen to your campaigns. They will continue to run on Facebook until their end date. You’ll be able to manage and edit your campaigns anytime directly from their native platform.
  After your subscription ends, you will no longer have access to MetaPro Support’s analytics and optimization tools until you renew your subscription. In particular, dayparting and MetaPro Support’s optimization rules will not be applied to your campaigns.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h5>Do you offer Marketing Services?</h5>
  <p>MetaPro Support is a self-service platform but we offer Marketing Services upon request, tailored to the needs of our users.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h5>Do you have specific features for Agencies?</h5>
  <p>All our plans come with the ability to add an unlimited number of ad accounts, which allows you to manage all of your clients’ ad accounts in one single place.
Moreover, we have a number of specific features particularly designed for agencies, such as the Campaign Approval flow, to quickly get your clients’ approval to publish a campaign and the Onboarding Requests feature which will allow you to request permissions for your clients’ ad accounts, pages, and CRMs.

  <h5>Can I take inspiration from my competitors with MetaPro Support?</h5>
  <p>Use MetaPro Support’s Ad Gallery to research what your competitors are doing, search through over 1.5 million Facebook and Twitter Ads to find your competitors’ ads, or even find some creative inspiration of your own. You’ll see a snapshot of each ad, as well as the headline, text, post link, and other ads from that same advertiser.

Quickly narrow down your results by any criteria you need – from basic options like platform and placement to more advanced options like objective or industry, the Ads Gallery is a one-stop inspiration hub for all things Ads.

  <h5>What is the spend limit?</h5>
  <p>Spend limit is a monthly limit that resets each month on your billing day, and only refers to campaigns created via MetaPro Support.
The limit refers to the amount you can manage via the platform for campaigns created in MetaPro Support, but you will still be billed by Facebook for the advertising spend itself.
  </p>
  <br>
