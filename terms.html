<br>
<h3>MetaPro Support Marketing Services – Campaign Review Terms</h3>
<p>The following Campaign Review Terms are specific to the service of CAMPAIGN REVIEWS (each a

    “Campaign Review”) offered by MetaPro Support LLC (“MetaPro Support” or “we”), and delivered by
    
    MetaPro Support or one of its marketing partners (each a “Marketer”). In these Campaign Review
    
    Terms, “you”, “your”, “Client”, and similar terms mean the person or legal entity requesting a Campaign Review. For the avoidance of doubt, if you request a Campaign Review on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, “you”, “your” or “Client” means the company or other legal entity on whose behalf you are requesting a Campaign Review.
    <br>
    These Campaign Review Terms are in addition to the MetaPro Support Terms of Service published at: https://metaprosupport.com/tos/ (the “MetaPro Support Terms”). Any terms we use in these Campaign Review Terms without defining them have the definitions given to them in the MetaPro Support Terms. These Campaign Review Terms will prevail to the extent of any conflict with the MetaPro Support Terms.
    <br>
    By requesting and paying for a Campaign Review, the Client expressly agrees to the MetaPro Support Terms and these Campaign Review Terms.
    <br>
    1. MetaPro Support or one of the Marketers will provide the Client with one (1) review of an advertising campaign on a single Advertising Platform, delivered to the Client in video-screencast format (the “Video”).
    <br>
    2. For Clients with paid MetaPro Support accounts, the Video will be recorded on MetaPro
    <br>
    Support’s interface. For Clients without MetaPro Support accounts, the Video will be recorded directly on the Client’s Advertising Platform account.
    <br>
    3. Campaign Reviews are available only during business days; if requested outside of normal business days, a Campaign Review will be completed and delivered on the next business day. A Campaign Review can be provided only in the languages offered by MetaPro Support at the time the Campaign Review is requested.
    <br>
    4. The Client acknowledges that MetaPro Support and one of its Marketers will access the Client’s
    <br>
    Advertising Platform account, and MetaPro Support account where applicable, for the sole purpose of conducting the Campaign Review. Such access will cease as soon as the Campaign Review has been completed.
    <br>
    5. For Clients without a paid MetaPro Support account requesting a Campaign Review for the first time, MetaPro Support will create a dashboard accessible by the Client, where that Campaign Review and any future Campaign Reviews will be delivered and stored; if the Client later opens a paid MetaPro Support account, the Client will get access to a new dashboard within the MetaPro Support interface, and all Campaign Reviews delivered previously will be transferred into this new dashboard. A Client cancelling a paid MetaPro Support account will lose access to both dashboards, including all Campaign Reviews; however, all Campaign Reviews completed by MetaPro Support will be retained by MetaPro Support for a minimum of one (1) year and will become available to the Client if the Client reopens a paid MetaPro Support account.
    <br>
    6. If the Client makes a mistake during the request process (e.g.: selects the wrong campaign, forgets to add comments to the request, etc.), the Client may notify MetaPro Support of this mistake by email to support@MetaPro Support.com; the Campaign Review may be cancelled and payment for it will be refunded while the Campaign Review request status shows on the Client’s MetaPro Support dashboard as ‘Requested’. A Campaign Review cannot be cancelled, nor will any refund by provided, when the Campaign Review request status shows on the Client’s MetaPro Support dashboard as ‘Assigned’, ‘Completed’ or ‘Delivered’.
    <br>
    7. The Campaign Review will be done in a cloned version of the original campaign for which the
    <br>
    Client requested the Campaign Review. After completion of the Campaign Review, this copied campaign will be deleted from the client’s Advertising Platform account. MetaPro Support will not work directly on any of the Client’s existing campaigns, other than on the one for which the Campaign Review is requested, and only for analysing its data and results.
    <br>
    8. A Campaign Review does not include follow up emails or calls to obtain more information about what is explained in the video. The Client may contact MetaPro Support via support@MetaPro Support.com to report mistakes in the Campaign Review’s content or process.
    <br>
    9. MetaPro Support does not allow its Marketers to contact the Client directly; any attempt to obtain information by a third party on behalf of MetaPro Support should be considered by the Client as suspicious and reported to support@MetaPro Support.com; this is the only mailbox from which MetaPro Support will communicate with the Client if required. Reciprocally, the Client shall not contact the Marketer delivering the Campaign Review directly; MetaPro Support may ban the Client from requesting additional Campaign Reviews, or using any other MetaPro Support services, for any breach of the foregoing restriction.
    <br>
    10. MetaPro Support will provide Campaign Reviews in compliance with MetaPro Support’s Privacy
    <br>
    Policy. MetaPro Support will not share any of the information contained in the client’s Advertising Platform account with any third parties other than the Marketer assigned to perform the requested Campaign Review, and only during the time the Campaign Review status shows as ‘Requested’ or ‘Assigned’ in the Client’s dashboard.
    <br>
    11. MetaPro Support retains all rights and interests in the Videos, and grants to the Client a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to download the Video and share it or store it “as it is”. The Client shall not edit or modify the Video in any way, without the prior written approval of MetaPro Support; MetaPro Support may ban the Client from requesting additional Campaign Reviews, or using any other MetaPro Support services, for any breach of the foregoing restriction.
    <br>
    12. MetaPro Support will not publish a campaign on the Client’s Advertising Platform account as part of the Campaign Review, nor modify any element of the Client’s Advertising Platform account, including (but not limited to): audiences, pixels, conversions, campaigns (and all its associated components and setting), users accessing the Advertising Platform account, or payment methods.

    13. The Client acknowledges and agrees that MetaPro Support is not responsible for: (a) sending any appeals to any Advertising Platform for rejected campaigns; or (b) the performance of the campaign for which a Campaign Review is requested (or for any other of the Client’s campaigns), whether or not the Client applied any suggestions provided in a Campaign Review.
    <br>
    14. MetaPro Support reserves the right to reject a Campaign Review for any reason, in its sole discretion; without limiting th
    <br>
    the campaigns violate any Third-Party Terms; (b) the Campaign Review would be substantially similar to another Campaign Review delivered recently to the same Client; or (c) the Campaign
    
    Review would not result in any suggested changes. If a Campaign Review is rejected, MetaPro Support will inform the Client of the rejection by email, and refund the fee paid for the Campaign Review to the Client.</p>

<h3>MetaPro Support Marketing Services – Coaching Terms</h3>

<p>The following Coaching Terms are specific to the service of COACHING (“Coaching”) offered by MetaPro Support LLC (“MetaPro Support” or “we”), and delivered by MetaPro Support or one of its marketing partners (each a “Marketer”). In these Coaching Terms, “you”, “your”, “Client”, and similar terms mean the person or legal entity requesting Coaching. For the avoidance of doubt, if you request Coaching on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, “you”, “your” or “Client” means the company or other legal entity on whose behalf you are requesting Coaching.</p>
<br>
<p>These Coaching Terms are in addition to the MetaPro Support Terms of Service published at:

    https://metaprosupport.com/tos/(the “MetaPro Support Terms”). Any terms we use in these Coaching Terms without defining them have the definitions given to them in the MetaPro Support Terms. These Coaching Terms will prevail to the extent of any conflict with the MetaPro Support Terms.</p>
<br>
<p>By requesting and paying for Coaching, the Client expressly agrees to the MetaPro Support Terms and these Coaching Terms.</p>
<br>
<p>MetaPro Support or one of the Marketers will provide the Client with one (1) 60-minute coaching session in the format of a video call over the Internet (the “Call”), and a video of that session recording (the “Recording”). The Call will take place over the Internet using a channel and tool selected by MetaPro Support; Coaching is not provided by telephone or in-person meeting. The Client may be able to connect to the Call by telephone, but only by using a dial-in number provided by MetaPro Support. MetaPro Support is not responsible for the quality and strength of the connection for any Call.</p>
<br>
<p>For Clients with paid MetaPro Support accounts, the Video will be recorded on MetaPro Support’s interface. For Clients without MetaPro Support accounts, the Video will be recorded directly on the Client’s Advertising Platform account.</p>
<br>
<p>Coaching is available only during business days; if requested outside of normal business days, Coaching will be completed and delivered on the next business day. Coaching can be provided only in the languages offered by MetaPro Support at the time Coaching is requested.</p>
<br>
<p>The Client acknowledges that MetaPro Support and one of its Marketers will access the Client’s Advertising Platform account, and MetaPro Support account where applicable, for the sole purpose of understanding the Client’s needs in order to provide Coaching in an effective manner. Such access will cease as soon as the Call has been completed.</p>
<br>
<p>For Clients without a paid MetaPro Support account requesting Coaching for the first time, MetaPro

    Support will create a dashboard accessible by the Client, where the Video (and any Video for a future
    
    Coaching request) will be delivered and stored; if the Client later opens a paid MetaPro Support account,
    
    the Client will get access to a new dashboard within the MetaPro Support interface, and all Videos delivered previously will be transferred into this new dashboard. A Client cancelling a paid MetaPro Support account will lose access to both dashboards, including all Videos; however, all Videos completed by MetaPro Support will be retained by MetaPro Support for a minimum of one (1) year and will become available to the Client if the Client reopens a paid MetaPro Support account.</p>
<br>
<p>If the Client makes a mistake during the request process (e.g.: selects the wrong Advertising Platform account, forgets to add comments to the request, etc.), the Client may notify MetaPro Support of this mistake by email to support@MetaPro Support.com; the Coaching request may be cancelled and payment for it will be refunded if cancellation is requested at least one (1) business day and at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled Call. (For example: if the Call is scheduled for Monday at noon, cancellation must be requested by noon on the Friday before.) Thereafter, the Coaching request may be cancelled prior to the scheduled Call, and 50% of the paid fee will be refunded.</p>
<br>
<p>If the Client does not show up for a scheduled Call, the Client may reschedule the Call once to a new date. If the Client does not show up for a rescheduled Call, then the Coaching request will be cancelled and MetaPro Support will keep the paid fee in full.</p>
<br>
<p>
    MetaPro Support will not work directly on any of the Client’s existing campaigns, nor will MetaPro Support create specific campaigns for the Client. Coaching does not include follow up emails or calls to obtain more information about anything explained during the Call or in the Video. The Client may contact MetaPro Support via support@MetaPro Support.com to report mistakes in the Coaching content or process.
</p>
<br>
<p>MetaPro Support does not allow its Marketers to contact the Client directly; any attempt to obtain information by a third party on behalf of MetaPro Support should be considered by the Client as suspicious and reported to support@MetaPro Support.com; this is the only mailbox from which MetaPro Support will communicate with the Client if required. Reciprocally, the Client shall not contact the Marketer delivering Coaching directly; MetaPro Support may ban the Client from additional Coaching requests, or using any other MetaPro Support services, for any breach of the foregoing restriction.</p>
<br>
<p>MetaPro Support will provide Coaching in compliance with MetaPro Support’s Privacy Policy. MetaPro Support will not share any of the information contained in the client’s Advertising Platform account with any third parties other than the Marketer assigned to perform the requested Coaching, and only during the time the Coaching request status shows as ‘Requested’ or ‘Assigned’ in the Client’s dashboard.</p>
<br>
<p>MetaPro Support retains all rights and interests in the Videos, and grants to the Client a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to download the Video and share it or store it “as it is”. The Client shall not edit or modify the Video in any way, without the prior written approval of MetaPro Support; MetaPro Support may ban the Client from additional Coaching requests, or using any other MetaPro Support services, for any breach of the foregoing restriction.</p>
<br>
<p>
    MetaPro Support will not publish a campaign on the Client’s Advertising Platform account as part of the Coaching, nor modify any element of the Client’s Advertising Platform account, including (but not limited to): audiences, pixels, conversions, campaigns (and all its associated components and setting), users accessing the Advertising Platform account, or payment methods
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The Client acknowledges and agrees that MetaPro Support is not responsible for: (a) sending any appeals to any Advertising Platform for rejected campaigns; or (b) the performance of the campaign for which Coaching is requested (or for any other of the Client’s campaigns), whether or not the Client applied any suggestions provided in during Coaching.

MetaPro Support reserves the right to reject a Coaching request for any reason, in its sole discretion; without limiting the foregoing, MetaPro Support may reject a Coaching request if: (a) one or more campaigns in the Client’s Advertising Platform account violate any Third-Party Terms; or (b) the

Coaching requested would be substantially similar to Coaching recently provided to the same Client. If a Coaching request is rejected, MetaPro Support will inform the Client of the rejection by email, and refund the fee paid for Coaching to the Client.
